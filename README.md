#COMP 537 Intelligent User Interfaces - Term Project
##Signature Generator

The following packages should be installed:

* python 2.7
* numpy
* scipy

Please fill in the PNG file 'template' with signatures( watching
the video.ogv may be helpful)
To learn a batch of signatures in png files:

    make all-pkl

Then for generation:

    make all-gen

Than to learn for only one signature;

    make nameOfUser.png

it will produce a pkl file and nameOfUser directory with several
png files.

To generate an image:

    make nameOfUser-gen.JPEG

It takes quite amount of time, be patient.

Please take a look at report.pdf but it is pretty slopy due to
some unfortunate incidents. it will be better in future, I believe.
But here's [a link](https://github.com/wolet/deep-belief-networks)! a tutorial on both Deep Belief Networks and Restricted Boltzmann Machines.
